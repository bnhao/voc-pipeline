## 🚨 Top 3 Critical Pain Points
*   **Widespread Mobile App Malfunctions:** Clients are experiencing consistent failures with core app functionalities including e-transfers, cheque deposits, biometric login, and random logouts/crashes, leading to significant disruption in daily banking activities and product-specific issues (e.g., incorrect balances for chequing/Mastercard accounts).
*   **Confusing New Digital Interface:** The recent interface update has created widespread confusion, making it difficult for users to locate essential information and details for various products like mortgages, savings, credit cards, and business accounts.
*   **Extended Wait Times & Deteriorating Customer Service Quality:** Both physical branches (e.g., Calgary, Edmonton, Lethbridge) and digital/phone support channels ("digital appweb") are plagued by unacceptably long wait times. Clients also report frustrating, slow, and generally unacceptable service interactions once connected.

## 💡 Recommended Strategic Actions
*   **Prioritize Urgent Mobile App Stabilization & QA:** Immediately allocate resources for a rapid bug fix sprint focusing on critical transaction failures (e-transfers, cheque deposits) and app instability. Implement a more rigorous Quality Assurance (QA) and user acceptance testing process before future updates.
*   **Conduct Comprehensive UX Audit & Enhance Interface Guidance:** Launch an immediate user experience (UX) audit of the new interface, incorporating direct client feedback. Develop and integrate in-app tutorials, tooltips, and easily accessible help resources to guide users in navigating the new layout and finding product details.
*   **Optimize Staffing & Improve Service Delivery Across Channels:** Review and adjust staffing levels and scheduling for both branch personnel and call centre agents to mitigate wait times. Invest in advanced training for customer service teams on new digital features and common issues to improve interaction quality and resolution efficiency.

## 📝 Summary Context
Clients are expressing deep frustration and disappointment, primarily due to significant regressions in digital banking functionality and service accessibility. The feedback suggests a critical need to address core operational deficiencies impacting daily banking activities.
