## 🚨 Top 3 Critical Pain Points
*   **Persistent Mobile Banking Application Failures & Usability Issues:** Clients are experiencing significant frustration with critical app functionalities such as failed e-transfers, rejected cheque deposits, random logouts, and general instability (crashes, freezing). Furthermore, the new interface is widely reported as confusing, hindering users from easily finding account details for various products.
*   **Extended Wait Times and Subpar Service Quality:** There are widespread complaints about excessively long wait times at both physical branches (e.g., Calgary, Edmonton, Lethbridge) and digital channels, coupled with consistently negative feedback describing customer service interactions as "unacceptable," "horrible," and "frustrating."
*   **Overly Aggressive Fraud Protection Measures Impacting Travelers:** A significant number of clients reported their cards being locked by fraud protection while traveling, specifically noted "in Banff," leading to considerable inconvenience, distress, and negative sentiment during their trips.

## 💡 Recommended Strategic Actions
*   **Comprehensive Mobile App Review & Remediation:** Initiate an urgent, in-depth technical audit of the recent mobile app update, prioritizing immediate bug fixes for critical functionalities (e-transfers, cheque deposits, biometric login) and addressing interface usability issues to ensure intuitive navigation and clear access to account information.
*   **Enhance Service Channel Efficiency & Training:** Implement immediate operational adjustments to reduce wait times across all service channels, including optimizing staffing at high-volume branches and call centres. Simultaneously, roll out targeted customer service training focused on empathy, efficient issue resolution, and effective utilization of bank resources.
*   **Refine Fraud Protection Protocols for Travelers:** Review and adjust fraud detection algorithms to better differentiate legitimate travel spending from fraudulent activity. Introduce enhanced pre-travel notification options within digital banking platforms to allow clients to proactively inform the bank of their travel plans, thereby minimizing unwarranted card suspensions.
